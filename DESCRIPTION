Package: MFM
Title: Multinomial fine-mapping
Description: MFM is a computationally efficient approach to simultaneously 
	     fine-map several related diseases and borrows information 
	     between diseases in a Bayesian framework. Joint models that 
	     have at least one shared causal variant between a pair of 
	     diseases are given higher weight than those without shared 
	     variants. MFM has greater accuracy than single disease analysis 
	     when shared causal variants exist, and negligible loss of 
	     precision otherwise. The best SNP models are summarised in terms of
             sets of correlated SNPs that have a similar impact on the
             trait. This approach is an extension of the GUESSFM
             software for fine-mapping of single traits and relies on
             several of the functions from that software.
